Create a button
When the button is clicked, get the data from a given url with an AJAX call. \
Show the details of all users in a Table. \

**URL:** https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users \

**BONUS:** Try to show the complex properties in the table aswell :)

**NOTE:** It is recommended to use Fetch. JQuery will be fine as well :)
