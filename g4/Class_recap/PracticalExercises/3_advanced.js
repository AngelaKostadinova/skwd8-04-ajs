//Task 1
//Write a JavaScript program to check whether a matrix is a diagonal matrix or not. 
//In linear algebra, a diagonal matrix is a matrix in which the entries outside 
//the main diagonal are all zero (the diagonal from the upper left to the lower right).
//Hint: Matrix == 2 dimensional array(array of arrays)

//Task 2
//Write a JavaScript program to remove duplicate items from an array

//Task 3
//Write a JavaScript program which accept a number as input and insert dashes (-) between 
//each two even numbers. For example if you accept 025468 the output should be 0-254-6-8.

//Task 4
//Write a JavaScript program which prints the elements of the following array. Note: Use nested for loops.
//Sample array: var a = [[1, 2], [8, 11], [7, 0, 7, 27], [7, 4, 28, 14], [3, 10, 26, 7]];

//Task 5
//Find all the palindroms in the array. A palindrom is a word that is equal to the reversed word. Ex : "Ana" , "Bob" "boob"

//Task 6
//Create a new array that the elements are the lenghts of the elements in the previous array.

//BONUS

//Task FizzBuzz
//Part 1
//Create a function that will take a number as parameter and print in console all the numbers to that number.
//number divisible by 3 print Fizz
//number divisible by 5 print Buzz
//number divisible by 3 and divisible by 5 print FizzBuzz
//Part 2
//Add input in the HTML and a button. On click of the button print the values up to the entered number.


//TASK Coin Denomination
//Given these coin denominations: 1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 20¢, 50¢, find the smallest number of coins needed for a given amount
//Example 1: For 375 cents, 9 coins are needed
//Example 2: For 543 cents, 15 coins are needed
//bonus1 - Make the finite amount for each coin
//bonus2 - Make a report how many coins of each kind were used to return a change
//bonus3 - Make an UI :)


//TASK Number Checker
//Part 1
//Write a function that will give stats about an integer number.
//The function should return an object with the stats as properties. The stats required are:

//1. Whats the value of the number (value property)
//2. How many digits the number has (numDigits property)
//3. Is the number odd or even (isEven property)
//4. Is the number positive (isPositive property)
//Part 2
//Write user interface for the number checker. It should include an entry field for the number as well as a 
//button to trigger the calculation. After the calculation, and appropriate response should be shown on the page.
